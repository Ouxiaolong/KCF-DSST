# KCF-DSST

This package includes a C++ class with several tracking methods based on the Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) [1, 2] for translation changes and the Discriminative Scale Space Tracker (DSST) [3] .   

DSST scaling changing part is added to the original kcftracker.cpp/hpp file. Original recttools.hpp and ffttools.hpp are also modified. Debug mode is added to the Cmakelists.txt.
